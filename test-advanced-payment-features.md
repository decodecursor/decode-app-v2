## ðŸ§ª **Testing Instructions**

### Test 1: Basic Payment Splitting
1. **Create Payment Link with Splits**
   ```
   Service: "Hair Styling Session"
   Amount: $100.00
   Recipients:
   - You (Primary): 70%
   - Assistant: sarah@example.com, 20%
   - Platform Fee: 10%
   ```

2. **Verify Split Configuration**
   - Check percentages total 100%
   - Confirm recipients are saved correctly
   - Validate primary recipient designation

3. **Test Payment Processing**
   - Complete a test payment
   - Verify split transactions are created automatically
   - Check distribution amounts match percentages

### Test 2: Fixed Amount Splits
1. **Create Payment with Fixed Amounts**
   ```
   Service: "Wedding Makeup Package"
   Amount: $300.00
   Recipients:
   - Makeup Artist: $200.00 (fixed)
   - Hair Stylist: $80.00 (fixed)
   - Platform Fee: 6.67% (percentage of remaining $20)
   ```

2. **Verify Mixed Split Types**
   - Fixed amounts are processed first
   - Percentage applies to remaining amount
   - Total distribution equals payment amount

### Test 3: Split Templates
1. **Create Template**
   ```
   Template: "Studio Team Split"
   Description: "Standard 70/20/10 split for studio work"
   Recipients:
   - Primary Artist: 70%
   - Assistant: 20%
   - Platform Fee: 10%
   ```

2. **Apply Template to Payment Link**
   - Select template during payment creation
   - Verify recipients are populated correctly
   - Modify template recipients if needed

3. **Template Management**
   - Create multiple templates
   - Set default template
   - Edit and update templates

### Test 4: Validation Testing
1. **Test Invalid Configurations**
   - Percentages exceeding 100%
   - Fixed amounts exceeding payment total
   - Missing recipient contact information
   - Multiple primary recipients

2. **Verify Error Messages**
   - Clear, helpful error descriptions
   - Real-time validation feedback
   - Prevention of invalid submissions

### Test 5: Analytics Verification
1. **Create Multiple Split Payments**
   - Various split configurations
   - Different recipient types
   - Mixed success/failure scenarios

2. **Check Analytics Dashboard**
   - Split payment metrics are accurate
   - Distribution status tracking works
   - Top recipients are identified correctly
   - Revenue distribution is calculated properly

### Test 6: Mobile Responsiveness
1. **Test on Mobile Devices**
   - Split configuration UI works on mobile
   - Template selection is touch-friendly
   - Review screens are readable
   - Form validation works on mobile

### Test 7: Edge Cases
1. **Rounding and Precision**
   - Test with amounts that create rounding issues
   - Verify total distributions equal payment amount
   - Check handling of fractional cents

2. **Empty Split Configurations**
   - Payment links with no splits (100% to creator)
   - Payments with splits removed after creation
   - Template application to existing splits

3. **Recipient Edge Cases**
   - Invalid email addresses
   - Duplicate recipients
   - Platform users that don't exist
   - External emails with special characters

### Test 8: Database Integrity
1. **Cascade Operations**
   - Deleting payment links removes split recipients
   - Template deletion removes template recipients
   - Transaction completion triggers split creation

2. **Data Consistency**
   - Split percentages and amounts are consistent
   - Distribution status updates correctly
   - Analytics calculations match raw data

## ðŸ“Š **Expected Results**

- âœ… **Validation**: Invalid configurations are caught and explained
- âœ… **Analytics Integration**: Split metrics appear in analytics dashboard
- âœ… **Mobile Compatibility**: All features work on mobile devices
- âœ… **Data Integrity**: Database constraints prevent invalid data

### Performance Expectations:
- **Split Calculation**: < 100ms for complex configurations
- **Template Application**: < 500ms to apply template to payment link
- **Analytics Generation**: < 2s for split payment analytics
- **Validation**: Real-time validation with < 100ms response

## ðŸ”’ **Security Verification**

### Row Level Security Tests:
1. **Split Recipients**: Users can only view/modify splits for their payment links
2. **Split Transactions**: Users can only see distributions for their payments or where they're recipients
3. **Templates**: Users can only access their own templates
4. **Earnings**: Users can only view their own earnings data

### Data Validation Tests:
1. **Split Validation**: Server-side validation prevents invalid configurations
2. **Input Sanitization**: Email addresses and names are properly sanitized
3. **SQL Injection**: Database queries are parameterized and safe
4. **Authorization**: Only authenticated users can create/modify splits
