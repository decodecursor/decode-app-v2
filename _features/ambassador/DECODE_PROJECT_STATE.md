## Brand & terminology

- **Brand name:** DECODE (NEVER use "WLD" — that was chat-only shorthand)
- **Feature name:** Ambassador feature (or "model" feature internally — matches existing user role)
- **User role:** `Model` (Title Case, already exists in `users.role`)
- **URL prefix:** `/model/*` for ambassador routes
- **Public URL pattern:** `welovedecode.com/{slug}` (e.g. `welovedecode.com/sarajohnson`)
- **Table prefix:** `model_*` (drop = feature gone)

# PHASE 1 — ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS (LOCKED)

| # | Decision | Locked Value |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Platform commission | **20% deducted from ambassador's earnings** |
| 2 | Stripe Connect | **No Connect** — DECODE platform Stripe + manual payouts |
| 3 | Payouts | **Manual** — admin clicks "Pay" on Wednesdays |
| 4 | Crossmint (crypto) | **Not included** — Stripe-only |
| 5 | Realtime | **Off** — page loads + user actions only |
| 6 | PayPal payouts | **Bank only V1**, PayPal V2 |
| 7 | Domain | `app.welovedecode.com` for now; relative paths in code so apex migration is trivial later |
| 8 | URL prefix | `/model/` (matches existing `Model` role) |
| 9 | Table prefix | `model_` |
| 10 | Auth | Reuse existing Supabase auth + AUTHKey patterns. Don't rebuild. |
| 11 | Email | ~~Allow `users.email = NULL` for new ambassador auth flow (no fake @whatsapp.decode.local emails)~~ **SUPERSEDED by decisions #19–21 in Slice 1.5.** Initial implementation used synthetic `wa_{hash}@auth.internal` emails via `generateLink({type:'magiclink'})` — this auto-created duplicate auth.users rows per human. Slice 1.5 Path B fixes this by populating `auth.users.phone` natively via `auth.admin.createUser({ phone, phone_confirm: true })` so phone is the authoritative identity (deterministic synthetic email is retained only as a session-mint fixture, hidden from UI by `isInternalEmail` filter). |
| 12 | Stripe integration | Stripe Payment Intents + Stripe Elements (custom modal, NOT hosted Checkout) |
| 13 | Video storage | **Supabase Storage only** (bucket `model-media`). NO transcoding service for V1. Accept that iPhone HEVC videos may not play on Firefox / older Android (95%+ of beauty industry users on iPhone Safari + Chrome where HEVC plays fine). Revisit if visitor complaints arise — can add Cloudflare Stream later. |
| 14 | Image processing | **2-stage compression:** (1) Client-side resize via `<canvas>` BEFORE upload using `browser-image-compression` library — max 1500x750 (cover), 1080x1080 (listing photos), 400x400 (professional avatar). (2) Server-side delivery via Next.js `<Image>` — Vercel automatically serves WebP/AVIF based on visitor's browser. Net result: phone 5MB photo → ~300KB stored → ~150KB delivered. |
| 15 | Video processing | **NO compression / NO transcoding.** Stored as-is on Supabase Storage. Strict limits enforced client-side BEFORE upload: **max 15 seconds duration, max 15MB file size**. Matches TikTok/Reels standard. Files larger or longer rejected with friendly error. Allowed formats: MP4, MOV, WebM (HEVC accepted but flagged as "may not play on Firefox"). |
| 16 | Storage bucket security | Bucket `model-media` RLS policies: **SELECT** = public (anyone can view). **INSERT** = authenticated users only, path must contain `auth.uid()` (e.g. `{uid}/cover.jpg`). **UPDATE** = owner only (path contains `auth.uid()`). **DELETE** = owner only. Prevents public upload of arbitrary files. |
| 17 | Bot protection | **Cloudflare Turnstile** (free invisible CAPTCHA) on (1) both checkout pages (`/{slug}/listing/{token}` and `/{slug}/wish/{token}`) and (2) auth pages that trigger sending costs — WhatsApp OTP (`/model/auth`) and email magic link (`/model/auth`). Verifies visitor is human BEFORE sensitive actions. Prevents wish-locking griefing AND prevents OTP spam that would drain AUTHKey credits. Combined with rate limiting: max 3 lock attempts per IP per 10 min on checkout; max 3 OTP per phone per hour + 10 per IP per hour on auth. |
| 18 | Notifications architecture | **Email via Resend + WhatsApp via AUTHKey.** Stripe Dashboard admin emails for payment/refund alerts (to admin only — no code). 3 custom Resend emails: (1) professional payment receipt, (2) gifter wish receipt, (3) professional listing-expiring-7-days reminder. 4 WhatsApp UTILITY templates (configured in AUTHKey dashboard, category=UTILITY not AUTHENTICATION): listing paid (to ambassador), wish gifted (to ambassador), listing expiring (to ambassador + to professional). All templates submitted for Meta pre-approval via AUTHKey. Code calls AUTHKey API with template ID (`wid`) + variables — same pattern as existing OTP flow. |
| 19 | Auth primacy | **WhatsApp is the primary sign-in method. Email is a secondary fallback only.** The `/model/auth` page leads with WhatsApp; email access is via "No WhatsApp?" link. Never equal-weight the two methods in UI. Email's role is account recovery and cross-device sign-in, not primary identity. (Locked 2026-04-19) |
| 20 | One human = one `auth.users` row | **Phone is the authoritative identity for WhatsApp signups; `auth.users.phone` is populated natively via `auth.admin.createUser({ phone, phone_confirm: true })`.** Email signups populate `email`; adding the other method later populates the empty column on the SAME row via `supabase.auth.updateUser()`. **Path B amendment (2026-04-19):** Path A (Supabase native `signInWithOtp({ phone })`) was attempted but blocked because the dashboard's Phone provider configuration form does not accept input in any browser, so the provider cannot be enabled. As a workaround, new WhatsApp users are created with **both** a populated `phone` column AND a deterministic synthetic `wa_{sha256(phone).slice(0,12)}@auth.internal` email — the synthetic email exists solely as a `generateLink` session-mint fixture and is hidden from all UI by `isInternalEmail()` (settings page filter). This is the B1 hybrid; identity remains the phone column. |
| 21 | Signup method determines Settings row order | In Settings Login methods card, the user's signup method always appears first; the added method appears second. Persisted as `public.users.signup_method TEXT` (`'whatsapp' | 'email'`) set at account creation and never flipped. Respects the user's mental model of "my account." (Locked 2026-04-19) |

# PHASE 1.5 — ARCHITECTURE PRINCIPLES (LOCKED)

Forward-looking engineering principles that all future slices must follow. Each principle captures a specific failure mode encountered in a prior slice, with the rule derived from it. Violations require explicit justification in the plan before implementation.

### Principle A — Identity field must be unmutable

Phone is the authoritative dedupe key for WhatsApp users. Never dedupe by email, synthetic email, or any field a user can mutate later.

**Origin:** Slice 1.5 phantom-row bug (commit `f3e886e`). Email-based dedupe broke as soon as Add Email overwrote the synthetic email.

### Principle B — One email pipeline: direct Resend with repo templates

ALL user-facing transactional and auth-flow emails go through direct Resend API with HTML templates in the repo (`lib/ambassador/email-templates.ts` or `components/emails/*.tsx`). Supabase dashboard-managed email templates are FORBIDDEN. One sender identity, one template source, one code-owned pipeline, no dashboard drift, no vendor lock.

**Origin:** Slice 1.5 Add Email flow initially used `supabase.auth.updateUser({ email })` which triggered Supabase's default email exposing synthetic `wa_*@auth.internal` addresses to users.

### Principle C — Opaque DB-owned tokens for confirmation links

Any confirmation link that may be clicked from a different browser/device than the one that requested it MUST use opaque DB-owned tokens, NOT Supabase's `admin.generateLink` output. Supabase's PKCE-bound tokens invalidate when clicked cross-browser. Pattern: app-owned table with `token`, `user_id`, `expires_at`, `consumed_at`, atomic-consume-and-apply via admin API.

**Origin:** Slice 1.5 Add Email flow returned `otp_expired` when user sent from phone and clicked from laptop.

### Principle D — auth.users writes must pair with public.users shadow writes in the same code path

Any code path that creates, modifies, or replaces `auth.users` rows MUST also write the shadow row in `public.users` atomically (same request). Shadow-ensure in callback is a self-heal net, not a replacement for write-time pairing.

**Origin:** Slice 1.5 Phase A shipped an FK violation on setup submit because the `public.users` row was never created on WhatsApp signup.

### Principle E — Match existing patterns before inventing new ones

Before building a feature, grep the codebase for existing patterns that solve similar problems. Match the pattern or explicitly justify why a new pattern is required in the plan.

**Origin:** Slice 1.5 Phase C built a new email architecture (Supabase `updateUser` path) while `send-magic-link/route.ts` already demonstrated the correct pattern (direct Resend). Architecture drift resulted.

### Principle F — TypeScript narrowing must survive the Next.js build pipeline

Local `npx tsc --noEmit` and Vercel's `next build` typecheck can produce different results for the same code, especially for discriminated-union narrowing. For Supabase SDK returns that use `{ data, error }` discriminated unions, destructure `{ data: X, error: Y }` up-front rather than keeping a combined variable; use `(param: any) =>` in `.find()` / `.filter()` callbacks for `listUsers`-style returns. Matches existing patterns in `check-email/route.ts`, `proxy-user-lookup/route.ts`, `users/invite/route.ts`.

**Origin:** Slice 1.5 commit `b9fbc79` — Vercel collapsed `User[] | []` to `never[]` while local tsc preserved the union.

### Principle G — End-to-end cross-browser smoke tests catch what same-browser tests miss

Paired with Guardrail 6 in CLAUDE_CODE_HANDOFF.md. Any flow that involves email confirmation links must be smoke-tested with request and click happening in DIFFERENT browser sessions (or incognito + regular) before that flow is declared verified.

**Origin:** Slice 1.5 Phase C Add Email worked in single-browser testing but failed cross-browser.

### Principle H — Slice scope discipline

Each slice targets ~1 to 1.5 days of focused work with a single, testable end-to-end outcome. If the scope breakdown shows >2 days or >3 phases, split into smaller slices before starting. Shorter slices = earlier drift detection = less rework.

**Origin:** Slice 1.5 at 3 days produced architectural drift (duplicate email pipeline, dedupe-by-email bug) because multiple concerns compounded. Added 2026-04-21 after proposing a 5-phase mega-Slice-2 that violated this rule — the split into Slices 2/3/4 was the corrective action.

**Addendum 2026-04-22 — Pre-flight UX-lock gate (Slice 2 session lesson).** Pre-flight audit caught 5/5 code surprises this session but missed two UX-churn cases: B3→2.5 (action sheet superseded by direct-edit within hours) and 2.6→2.7 (onboarding mode branch added then deleted within ~30 min). Root cause: UX-churn isn't a code surprise, it's an un-locked upstream decision. For UI-heavy slices, pre-flight must add a "UX pattern locked?" gate — a 10-minute sketch review before any code is written. Net progress in both cases was still real (B3→2.5 delivered direct-edit; 2.6→2.7 delivered -90 lines of duplicate drag/position logic in `setup/page.tsx`), so neither is retrospectively regrettable — but both were avoidable with an earlier UX lock.

---

# PHASE 1.6 — FEATURE COMPLETENESS GAP (acknowledged, deferred)

Every editable profile/account field and whether Add/Change/Delete flows are specced.

| Field | Add | Change | Delete | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Email | Slice 1.5 ✓ | Slice 2 ✓ shipped (d8468d8) | Via delete profile | Complete |
| WhatsApp phone | Slice 1.5 ✓ | Slice 2 ✓ shipped (f6c3201) | Via delete profile | Complete |
| First/last name | Slice 1 ✓ | Slice 1 ✓ | Via delete profile | Complete |
| Slug | Slice 1 ✓ | Slice 1 ✓ | Via delete profile | Complete |
| Tagline | Slice 1 ✓ | Slice 1 ✓ | Not specced | Minor |
| Instagram handle | Slice 1 ✓ | Slice 1 ✓ (assumed) | — | VERIFY |
| Currency | Slice 1 ✓ | LOCKED (intentional) | — | Complete |
| Cover photo | Slice 1 ✓ (upload + reposition) | Slice 1 ✓ (reposition) | Slice 2 ✓ shipped (81d5f1a); Slice 2.5 ✓ reposition UX + shared `<CoverPhoto>` (3ae5ffe); Slice 2.7 ✓ onboarding unified with Settings edit UX (545e485) | Complete |
| Beauty Wishlist toggle | Slice 5 | n/a | n/a | Deferred |

Slice 2 shipped the Change modals for Email + WhatsApp and the Cover photo Remove action (B1 `d8468d8`, B2 `f6c3201`, B3 `81d5f1a`). The previously-listed "Profile photo / avatar" row was a phantom gap from an outdated read of the schema — the ambassador has no round avatar; the round avatar field (`avatar_photo_url`) belongs to `model_professionals` and is built in Slice 3's Add Listing form.

---

# PHASE 1.7 — EMAIL TEMPLATE CATALOG (single source of truth)

Every email the app sends. Reviewed per Principle B.

| # | Trigger | Subject | From | Pipeline | Repo location | Template shape |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Email magic-link sign-in | Your Secure Login Link | WeLoveDecode `<noreply@welovedecode.com>` | Resend direct | `send-magic-link/route.ts` inline HTML | WeLoveDecode wordmark + pink button |
| 2 | Add email confirmation | Add this email to your WeLoveDecode account (flow='add' branch) | WeLoveDecode `<noreply@welovedecode.com>` | Resend direct | `add-email/route.ts` via `renderButtonEmail` helper | WeLoveDecode wordmark + pink button |
| 2b | Change email confirmation | Confirm your new email for WeLoveDecode | WeLoveDecode `<noreply@welovedecode.com>` | Resend direct | `add-email/route.ts` via `renderButtonEmail` (flow='change' branch) | WeLoveDecode wordmark + pink button |
| 3 | Payment receipt (professional) | — | — | Resend via `lib/email-service.ts` | `components/emails/PaymentReceipt.tsx` (React template) | Existing transactional |
| 4 | Payment confirmation (gifter) | — | — | Resend via `lib/email-service.ts` | `components/emails/PaymentConfirmation.tsx` | Existing |
| 5 | Payment failed | — | — | Resend via `lib/email-service.ts` | `components/emails/PaymentFailed.tsx` | Existing |
| 6 | Listing expiring reminder (7d) | TBD | — | Resend | TBD Slice 2/5 | Not yet built |
| 7 | Stripe Dashboard admin alerts | Stripe default | Stripe | Stripe-native | n/a | Admin only |

**Rule:** ALL new email triggers added in future slices MUST be added to this table BEFORE implementation. Any email sent without a matching row here is a violation of Principle B.

---

# PHASE 1.8 — SLICE 2 ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS (Change modals + Cover remove)

Slice 2 closes three gaps deferred from Slice 1.5 Phase C (Principle H — scope discipline): Change Email modal, Change WhatsApp modal, Cover photo Remove action. All wiring mirrors Slice 1.5 patterns (Principle E).

### Q1 — Reuse `email_change_requests` table: **REUSE**
Add Email and Change Email are the same semantic operation ("apply a new email to `auth.users` after user-confirmed link"). Two additive columns:
- `old_email text NULL` — snapshotted at request-creation time so the confirmation page can render Old → New without URL params (per `change_email_confirmation_final_UI_Spec.md` §3). NULL for legacy Add Email rows, populated from Slice 2 onward.
- `flow text NOT NULL DEFAULT 'add' CHECK (flow IN ('add','change'))` — discriminator so the callback can branch its redirect, and so the email subject/body can differ per flow.

### Q2 — Reuse `/model/auth/confirm-email` callback route: **REUSE**
One new branch: after successful `updateUserById` + shadow update, select redirect URL by `flow`:
- `flow='add'` → `/model/settings` (unchanged).
- `flow='change'` → `/model/auth/email-changed?ref={token}` (new).
The `ref={token}` is the already-consumed token, reused as a DB lookup key. The page is a **server component** that requires `consumed_at IS NOT NULL` AND `consumed_at > now() - interval '15 minutes'`. Satisfies UI Spec §3 "server-render, no URL params for emails".

### Q3 — Cross-browser behavior (Principle G): no new work
The opaque-token callback is session-independent by construction. Verified via smoke test (Browser A request, Browser B click).

### Q4 — Routing after email confirmation: **split by flow**
- Add Email "old" is the synthetic `wa_…@auth.internal` (meaningless / would leak internal fixture) → stay at `/model/settings`.
- Change Email has a real "old" that matters → show Old→New cards at `/model/auth/email-changed`.

### Q5 — Change WhatsApp confirmation UI: **self-contained in the modal**
Step 3 of the Change WhatsApp modal shows "WhatsApp changed!" with Old→New cards per `settings.html:247–285`. No separate page needed — modal closes on Done and Settings re-reads from refreshed session/profile.

### Reuse summary (Principle E evidence)
- `/api/ambassador/auth/add-email` — extended, not forked (flow detection via `isInternalEmail(sessionUser.email)`).
- `/model/auth/confirm-email` — extended with one flow-branch redirect.
- `/api/ambassador/auth/send-otp` + `/api/ambassador/auth/add-phone` — reused unchanged (idempotent).
- `email_change_requests` table — extended with two additive columns.
- `renderButtonEmail`, `ProgressTracker`, `CountryPicker`, `OtpInput` — reused unchanged.
- `extractCoverObjectPath` + `storage.from(COVER_BUCKET).remove([…])` pattern — reused for cover remove.

### Migration (Phase B1)
```sql
ALTER TABLE public.email_change_requests
  ADD COLUMN old_email text NULL,
  ADD COLUMN flow text NOT NULL DEFAULT 'add' CHECK (flow IN ('add','change'));
```

### Scope (Principle H)
5 deliverables, ≤1.5 days, 1 Phase A doc commit + 3 Phase B code commits (B1 Email, B2 WhatsApp, B3 Cover).

### Close-out
Slice 2 shipped d8468d8 + f6c3201 + 81d5f1a, verified on Vercel, all Q1–Q5 decisions honored in code.

Slice 2.5 (cover reposition UX + shared `<CoverPhoto>` component) shipped 3ae5ffe: scroll-hijack eliminated via direct-edit pattern (tap camera → edit mode → Drag pill + Upload/Remove/Done), `CoverPhotoActionSheet` (B3) superseded and deleted, `CoverCameraButton` viewBox centering fixed. `/model/setup/page.tsx` cover drag intentionally not migrated — distinct absolute-positioned `<img>` implementation, logged in CLAUDE_CODE_HANDOFF.md hardening backlog.

Slice 2.7 (545e485) removed `mode='onboarding'` from `<CoverPhoto>`; both Settings and `/model/setup` now use the identical `'fixed'`/`'editing'` tap-to-edit pattern. Supersedes `onboarding_register_model_final_UI_Spec.md §5` (fade-on-drag pill). Slice 2.6 (cdab6c1) completed the underlying `/model/setup` migration to the shared component, closing the hardening-backlog item logged after 2.5.

Slice H1 (b1284eb) completed the partial ESLint flat-config migration that was blocking `npm run lint`. Restored `next lint`'s implicit ignores (`.next/`, `tests/e2e/`, `aws-lambda/`, `scripts/`, `node_modules/`), scoped `@typescript-eslint/*` rules to `**/*.{ts,tsx}` so the plugin loads via the `next/typescript` compat block, and downgraded 4 noisy rules to `warn` (`no-explicit-any`, `no-require-imports`, `no-html-link-for-pages`, `react-hooks/rules-of-hooks`) to unblock without hiding genuine issues. Auto-fixed 8 `prefer-const` occurrences across 7 files; inline-disabled two legitimate exceptions (`lib/stripe-client.ts:26` intentional Stripe CDN preload; `app/api/beauty-businesses/create/route.ts:36` mixed-destructure pattern). Logged 2 deferred React Rules-of-Hooks bugs in auction components for a dedicated bug-fix slice. Result: `npm run lint` exit 0 with 2,357 warnings (down from 22,727 problems).

Slice H2 (1dfa086) flipped `model_payouts.model_id` FK from NO ACTION to CASCADE — latent bug fix on an empty table; matches `auction_payouts.model_id` semantics; prevents a broken pointer when `model_profiles` cascade-deletes from a `users` deletion. Full audit via `pg_constraint` revealed 42 FKs in the public schema (1 to `auth.users.id` on `email_change_requests`, 16 to `public.users.id`, 25 intra-schema). `beauty_offers.created_by` + `beauty_purchases.buyer_id` intentionally deferred — both are NOT NULL, so SET NULL requires dropping NOT NULL + a grep audit of downstream code for NULL handling. Logged as a hardening-backlog item.

Slice H3 (8fc50c4 + 925c815) bundled two small hardening fixes. Part 1 (`8fc50c4`) fixed React Rules-of-Hooks violations in `components/auctions/BiddingInterface.tsx` (debug-only `useEffect` + `activeClientSecret` const lifted above the "Bidding is closed" early return) and `components/auctions/VideoUploadCountdown.tsx` (`useVideoUploadTimer` lifted above the null-return early exit); lint warnings 2,357 → 2,355. Part 2 (`925c815`) dropped the duplicate singular `user_bank_account` table — 0 rows, 0 code references, 10-col stub, no inbound FKs, no triggers, no view refs (4 RLS policies cascade-dropped with the table). Canonical `user_bank_accounts` (plural, 18-col, referenced by `model_payouts.bank_account_id`, 17+ code consumers) untouched.

---

# PHASE 2 — FEE DISPLAY STRATEGY (LOCKED)

The 20% platform fee is displayed selectively across DECODE pages:

| Page | Shows | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `/model` Dashboard | **Gross (100%)** | "What I made happen" — vibe / motivation |
| `/model/analytics` | **Gross (100%)** | Performance view |
| `/model/listings` | **Gross (100%)** | What was paid by professionals |
| `/model/wishlist` | **Gross (100%)** | What was paid by gifters |
| `/model/payouts` (list) | **Net (80%)** | What hits the bank |
| `/model/payouts/[id]` (statement) | **Net (80%) + Gross (100%)** | Audit/reconciliation — only place both appear |
| `/wish/confirmation/{pi_xxx}` receipt | Gross (100%) | What gifter paid |
| `/listing/confirmation/{pi_xxx}` receipt | Gross (100%) | What professional paid |
| `/model/settings` | Nothing about fees | Clean UI |
| Terms of Service | Disclosure (legal text only) | Legal compliance |

**CRITICAL RULES for Claude Code:**
- Platform fee is **never explicitly displayed as "20%"** anywhere except in Terms
- The word "fee" is **never shown to ambassadors** in the UI
- Server stores `gross_amount` (100%), `platform_fee` (20%), `net_amount` (80%) per transaction — calculated ONCE at payment, never recalculated
- **Never derive net from a "current fee %" at display time** — historical transactions must always show the fee that applied AT THE TIME of the transaction

---

# PHASE 3 — RACE CONDITION HANDLING (LOCKED)

Wishes are one-time purchases (only one gifter wins). Race protection:

```
1. Gifter taps "Pay $75" (FIRST pay button on checkout page)
2. Server: atomic UPDATE model_wishes SET status='taken' WHERE id=X AND status='available'
3. Success (1 row updated) → create Stripe PaymentIntent + open modal (10-min timer starts)
   Failure (0 rows updated) → redirect to "/wish/taken" page

4. Gifter enters card in modal → taps inner Pay → stripe.confirmPayment()
5a. Payment success → status STAYS 'taken' forever ✓
5b. Payment fail / cancel / abandon / 10-min timer expires → status reverts to 'available'
```

Industry standard pattern (Eventbrite, StubHub, Shopify limited drops, Airbnb).
No reservations needed. **No refunds for race conditions.**

`model_wishes.payment_attempt_expires_at` (timestamptz nullable) tracks the 10-min lock timer.

**Stripe integration:** custom modal + Stripe Payment Intents (NOT Stripe-hosted Checkout). Full timing control owned by DECODE.

---

# PHASE 4 — TRIAL / PAYMENT EXTENSION RULES (LOCKED)

**Universal rule:** New paid period ALWAYS starts at `MAX(now(), MAX(paid_until, free_trial_ends_at))`. Never overlaps. Never overwrites unused time.

**Trial → Paid (early upgrade — trial STACKED, not absorbed):**
```
Day 1:  Trial starts → free_trial_ends_at = Day 31
Day 11: Salon pays $50 for 60 days
        → period_start = Day 31 (after trial ends)
        → period_end = Day 91
        → status = 'active', is_free_trial = false
        → Trial days 11-31 remain valid (free)
```

**Active → Renewal (paid before expiry):**
```
Day 1:   Salon paid for 60 days → paid_until = Day 60
Day 40:  Salon renews early, pays $50 for 60 more days
         → period_start = Day 60 (extends from previous end)
         → period_end = Day 120
         → No double-charging, no overlap, no lost time
```

**Why STACKED not absorbed:** users hate losing trial days. Free trial = free trial. Customers paying early should be rewarded, not punished.

**Indexes:** unique on slug, on user_id, partial on gifts_enabled=true
**RLS:** public read (only when is_published=true), owner+Model insert/update/**delete**, admin all
**Self-delete:** Ambassador CAN self-delete profile (3-step modal). Hard delete cascades.

|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | id | uuid PK | gen_random_uuid() | |
| 2 | instagram_handle | text UNIQUE NOT NULL | — | dedup key, lowercase |
| 3 | name | text NOT NULL | — | "Salon de Luxe" |
| 4 | city | text NOT NULL | — | |
| 5 | country | text NOT NULL | — | full name (e.g. "United Arab Emirates") |
| 6 | avatar_photo_url | text NOT NULL | — | round 200px photo (mandatory per Add Listing form) |
| 7 | created_by | uuid FK NOT NULL | — | → users.id (first ambassador to add them) |
| 8 | created_at | timestamptz NOT NULL | now() | |
| 9 | updated_at | timestamptz NOT NULL | now() | auto-trigger |

**Indexes:** unique on instagram_handle, on city
**RLS:** public read, Model can INSERT (when adding listing), Model UPDATE only own (created_by), Admin all
**Smart-match flow:** NOT a separate UX overlay. Server checks Instagram uniqueness on Create Listing submit. If duplicate → error: "This Instagram is already linked to {existing.name}. Use that one instead."

## Table 3 — `model_listings` (21 columns)

| # | Column | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | id | uuid PK | gen_random_uuid() | |
| 2 | model_id | uuid FK NOT NULL | — | → model_profiles.id ON DELETE CASCADE |
| 3 | professional_id | uuid FK NOT NULL | — | → model_professionals.id |
| 4 | category_id | uuid FK nullable | — | → model_categories.id (XOR with category_custom) |
| 5 | category_custom | text nullable | — | XOR with category_id via CHECK constraint |
| 6 | media_type | text nullable | — | 'video' / 'photos' / NULL |
| 7 | video_url | text nullable | — | when media_type='video' |
| 8 | photo_url_1 | text nullable | — | 1st photo |
| 9 | photo_url_2 | text nullable | — | 2nd photo |
| 10 | photo_url_3 | text nullable | — | 3rd photo |
| 11 | price_30 | decimal(10,2) nullable | — | NULL if free trial |
| 12 | price_60 | decimal(10,2) nullable | — | |
| 13 | price_90 | decimal(10,2) nullable | — | |
| 14 | currency | text NOT NULL | — | snapshot from model_profiles |
| 15 | payment_link_token | text UNIQUE NOT NULL | — | 8-char public code (e.g. `a8Kx3mP2`) — increased from 5 per security review |
| 16 | status | text NOT NULL | 'pending_payment' | free_trial / pending_payment / active / expired |
| 17 | is_free_trial | bool NOT NULL | false | |
| 18 | free_trial_ends_at | timestamptz nullable | — | 30 days from creation if trial; KEEP set even after trial→paid conversion (audit trail) |
| 19 | paid_until | timestamptz nullable | — | latest period_end (updates on each renewal) |
| 20 | created_at | timestamptz NOT NULL | now() | |
| 21 | updated_at | timestamptz NOT NULL | now() | auto-trigger via `set_updated_at()` |

**Removals:** Hard DELETE for manual removals (no `removed` status). Active listings = blocked modal "Cannot delete until expires".
**Stacking:** Each renewal = NEW row in `model_listing_payments`, this table just updates `paid_until` to latest `period_end`.
**Category:** Either `category_id` (FK) OR `category_custom` (text) — never both
**Prices on this table are MUTABLE** (ambassador edits anytime on Send Payment Link page). Payment row snapshots are immutable.

## Table 4 — `model_wishes` (17 columns)

| # | Column | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | id | uuid PK | gen_random_uuid() | |
| 2 | model_id | uuid FK NOT NULL | — | → model_profiles.id ON DELETE CASCADE |
| 3 | service_name | text NOT NULL | — | from dropdown or custom input (text only, no FK) |
| 4 | professional_name | text nullable | — | free text (no FK to model_professionals) |
| 5 | professional_city | text nullable | — | from Add Wish form |
| 6 | professional_country | text nullable | — | from Add Wish form (full name) |
| 7 | price | decimal(10,2) NOT NULL | — | gross (what gifter pays) |
| 8 | currency | text NOT NULL | — | snapshot from model_profiles |
| 9 | status | text NOT NULL | 'available' | available / taken |
| 10 | taken_at | timestamptz nullable | — | when gifted |
| 11 | payment_attempt_expires_at | timestamptz nullable | — | NOW+10min when locked; NULL after success or revert |
| 12 | gifter_name | text nullable | — | from checkout form |
| 13 | gifter_instagram | text nullable | — | from checkout form |
| 14 | gifter_is_anonymous | bool NOT NULL | false | gifter chose to hide |
| 15 | payment_link_token | text UNIQUE NOT NULL | — | 8-char public code (e.g. `a8Kx3mP2`) — used in `/{slug}/wish/{token}` URL. Prevents enumeration. |
| 16 | created_at | timestamptz NOT NULL | now() | |
| 17 | updated_at | timestamptz NOT NULL | now() | auto-trigger |

**Deletion rule:** Available wishes = hard DELETE OK. Taken wishes = cannot delete.
**No `gifter_email`** — that lives only on `model_wish_payments` (single source of truth)
**Wishes are casual** — no FK to `model_categories` or `model_professionals` (snapshots only)

## Table 5 — `model_listing_payments` (21 columns)

| # | Column | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | id | uuid PK | gen_random_uuid() | internal |

| 20 | created_at | timestamptz NOT NULL | now() | |
| 21 | updated_at | timestamptz NOT NULL | now() | auto-trigger |

**Receipt URL:** `/listing/confirmation/{stripe_payment_intent_id}` (uses pi_xxx, not L8758745)
**No snapshot columns** — receipt always reads live data; if Sara deletes account, receipt 404s (acceptable)
**Rows are IMMUTABLE** (except status flips and refund fields)
**No `stripe_session_id`** — we use Stripe Payment Intents (custom modal), NOT Stripe Checkout Sessions

**No period_start/period_end** — admin batches all unpaid payments (where `payout_id IS NULL`) every Wednesday
**Bank snapshot:** `bank_name` + `bank_last4` saved at payout time (survives if bank account deleted)
**Linked payments via:** `model_listing_payments.payout_id` + `model_wish_payments.payout_id`

# PHASE 5A — SLICE 1.5 SCHEMA ADDITIONS (LOCKED)

## Overview

Slice 1.5 adds one optional column to `public.users` and cleans up phantom rows created by the Slice 1 synthetic-email bug. No new tables. No changes to `model_*` tables.

## Column addition

```sql
ALTER TABLE public.users
ADD COLUMN signup_method TEXT CHECK (signup_method IN ('whatsapp', 'email'));
```

- **Nullable** — backfilled from existing rows at migration time
- Set at account creation based on which Supabase auth method was used first
- Never updated after creation (even when the second method is added)
- Consumed by Settings Login methods card for dynamic row ordering (decision #21)

## Backfill strategy

For existing ambassadors at migration time:

```sql
UPDATE public.users SET signup_method = 'whatsapp'
WHERE email LIKE 'wa\_%@auth.internal' ESCAPE '\';

UPDATE public.users SET signup_method = 'email'
WHERE email NOT LIKE 'wa\_%@auth.internal' ESCAPE '\'
  AND signup_method IS NULL;
```

Order matters — WhatsApp-pattern rows get classified first; remaining rows with real emails get classified as email-primary.

## Phantom user cleanup (one-off migration)

The Slice 1 auth bug created duplicate `auth.users` rows for users who tried both WhatsApp and email sign-in. One-off cleanup migration:

```sql
-- Delete auth users that were created by the synthetic-email pattern
-- but have no corresponding model_profiles (orphans only — preserve real accounts).
DELETE FROM auth.users
WHERE email LIKE 'wa\_%@auth.internal' ESCAPE '\'
  AND id NOT IN (SELECT user_id FROM model_profiles);
```

Expected count in current dev DB: 1-5 rows. In production: 0 (launching clean).

## Ongoing phantom guard (`cleanup_phantom_auth_users()`)

Even after Slice 1.5 ships the auth-architecture fix, defensive cleanup is wired in case future regressions or manual data anomalies re-introduce phantom synthetic-email rows. The one-off DELETE above is supplemented by a SECURITY DEFINER function callable by `service_role`:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION cleanup_phantom_auth_users()
RETURNS integer
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER
SET search_path = public
AS $$
DECLARE
  deleted_count integer;
BEGIN
  WITH deleted AS (
    DELETE FROM auth.users
    WHERE email LIKE 'wa\_%@auth.internal' ESCAPE '\'
      AND id NOT IN (SELECT user_id FROM public.model_profiles)
    RETURNING id
  )
  SELECT count(*) INTO deleted_count FROM deleted;
  RETURN deleted_count;
END;
$$;

REVOKE ALL ON FUNCTION cleanup_phantom_auth_users() FROM PUBLIC;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION cleanup_phantom_auth_users() TO service_role;
```

Invocation: scheduled via `pg_cron` (e.g. nightly) OR exposed through a service-role admin endpoint that an operator can hit on demand. Exact wiring TBD during Slice 1.5 implementation; the function itself ships with the schema migration so it's always available.

## No changes to auth.users

The `auth.users` table is Supabase-managed. We do not alter its schema. We use:
- `auth.users.phone` (already exists, TEXT, nullable) — populated on WhatsApp signup
- `auth.users.email` (already exists, TEXT, nullable) — populated on email signup
- `auth.users.phone_confirmed_at` — set by Supabase after OTP verify
- `auth.users.email_confirmed_at` — set by Supabase after magic-link click

Both columns may be NULL at the same time momentarily during signup; exactly one will be populated after first confirmation.

# PHASE 6 — URL ARCHITECTURE (LOCKED)

## Final URL list (30 routes)

### Public (11)
- `/{slug}` — Public ambassador page
- (lightbox is overlay on `/{slug}`)
- `/{slug}/wish/{token}` — Wish gift checkout (8-char token)
- `/{slug}/listing/{token}` — Listing checkout (8-char token)
- `/wish/confirmation/{pi_xxx}` — Gift receipt (Stripe pi_xxx)
- `/listing/confirmation/{pi_xxx}` — Listing receipt (Stripe pi_xxx)
- `/wish/taken` — Edge case: wish already gifted
- `/listing/paid` — Edge case: listing already paid
- `/expired` — Generic expired/invalid link page
- `/terms` — Terms of Service
- `/privacy` — Privacy Policy

### Ambassador (10, login required)
- `/model` — Dashboard
- `/model/listings` — Listings page
- `/model/listings/new` — Add listing form
- `/model/listings/[id]/send-link` — Share payment link
- `/model/wishlist` — Wishlist page
- `/model/wishlist/new` — Add wish form
- `/model/analytics` — Analytics
- `/model/payouts` — Payouts list
- `/model/payouts/[id]` — Payout statement
- `/model/settings` — Settings

### Auth (8)
- `/model/auth` — Main auth page (WhatsApp-primary per Slice 1.5)
- `/model/auth/email` — Email fallback entry (Slice 1.5 — secondary entry, "No WhatsApp?" link)
- `/model/auth/verify` — WhatsApp OTP verify
- `/model/auth/sent` — Magic link email sent
- `/model/auth/email-changed` — Email change confirmation
- `/model/auth/email-confirmed` — Post-confirm redirect after Add email flow (Slice 1.5)
- `/model/auth/email-error` — Email error page
- `/model/setup` — Onboarding

### Catch-all (1)
- 404 page

### URL conventions
- Collections plural, single items singular (`/listings`, `/wish/`)
- `/new` for create pages
- 8-char tokens for branded checkouts (`payment_link_token`)
- References shown in receipts: `L8758745` (listings), `W8473921` (wishes), `P8473921` (payouts) — INSIDE receipt body, NEVER in URLs
- Receipt URLs use Stripe `pi_xxx`

# PHASE 7 — DESIGN TOKENS (LOCKED)

| Token | Value |
|---|---|
| Page bg (outer) | `#111` |
| Frame bg | `#000` |
| Frame border | `2px solid #1a1a1a` |
| Card bg | `#1c1c1c` |
| Row hover | `#262626` (LIGHTER than card — surfaces the row) |
| Pink accent (CTA) | `#e91e8c` |
| Green (status/success) | `#34d399` (or `#4ade80` for toast) |
| Body text | `#ccc` / `#fff` |
| Secondary | `#888` / `#777` / `#666` |
| Title | 22px / weight 700 |
| Body | 13px / line-height 1.65 |
| Micro text | 9–11px |
| Frame width | 375px (will use `max-width: 500px` + centered for iPad/desktop) |

**CSS strategy:** inline `<style>` per page, no global CSS to inherit baggage from old app.
**Route groups:** `app/(ambassador)/` for new feature, `app/(legacy)/` for old code.

# PHASE 8 — WORKFLOW (LOCKED)

```
1. Chat (Claude here): build/edit HTML mockup + UI spec
2. Save HTML + spec to /design/source-html/ and /design/ui-specs/ in repo
3. Hand to Claude Code: "Implement this page using design/X.html. Wire to API Y."
4. Claude Code does ONLY integration (API wiring, DB, deployment)
5. Visual changes go BACK to chat → never to Claude Code
```

# PHASE 9 — PAGE-BY-PAGE AUDIT (✅ ALL 21 DONE)

## Page 1 — Public ambassador page (`/{slug}`)
**File:** `public_page_final.html`

- Section titles ("My Beauty Squad", "My Beauty Wishlist", "My Wall of Love") = hardcoded in app
- Tagline shown on public page below display name
- Anonymous gifter → display "Anonymous", hide Instagram link
- Wall of Love → all completed gifts, newest first, no limit

## Page 2 — Public Media Lightbox (overlay)
**File:** `public_media_lightbox_final.html`
**Status:** No gaps.

## Page 3 — Listing Checkout (`/{slug}/listing/{token}`)
**File:** `checkout_for_listing-professional_final.html`

- Tap profile URL → opens Sara's actual public page in overlay (not customized preview)
- "Followers/Listings/Gifts" stats removed from design
- **No presentment subtitle on checkout** — shown only on receipt (industry standard)

## Page 4 — Wish Gift Checkout (`/{slug}/wish/{token}`)
**File:** `checkout_for_wish-gifter_final.html`

- Gifter data saved AFTER Stripe payment confirms (via webhook)
- Server-side guard checks wish status before creating Stripe session (race condition prevention via atomic claim)
- Removed `gifter_email` from `model_wishes` — kept only on `model_wish_payments`
- Added `payment_attempt_expires_at` (10-min lock timer) to `model_wishes`
- **No presentment subtitle on checkout** — shown only on receipt

## Page 5 — Listing Payment Confirmation (`/listing/confirmation/{pi_xxx}`)
**File:** `listing_payment_confirmation_final.html`

- URL uses Stripe `pi_xxx`, reference `L8758745` shown only in body
- "Contact Sara" is informational text, not link — no change needed
- Skip ambassador snapshot columns (live read from FK; deleted account = receipt 404)
- Added 4 columns: `refunded_at`, `refund_amount`, `presentment_amount`, `presentment_currency`
- Presentment shown when card currency differs (e.g. "Charged as INR 1,580 on your card")

## Page 6 — Wish Gift Confirmation (`/wish/confirmation/{pi_xxx}`)
**File:** `wish-gift_payment_confirmation_for_gifter_final.html`

- Anonymous gifter CTA = "See your gift on Sara's page →"
- Non-anonymous gifter CTA = "See your name on Sara's page →"
- Share text already correct: "I just gifted Sara a beauty wish ❤️ {url}"
- URL shared = ambassador's public page
- Same 4 columns added to `model_wish_payments` (refunds + presentment)

## Page 7 — Dashboard (`/model`)
**File:** `dashboard_final.html`

- Added `dashboard_first_seen_at` for first-visit greeting
- "Expiring soon" alert threshold = 7 days
- Only Listings nav row shows alerts (Wishlist/Analytics/Settings = no alerts in V1)
- "Top clicks" = combine `listing_instagram_click` + `listing_media_click` per category

**Slice 1.5 additions:**
- Settings nav card shows `Settings · Email missing` pink hint when `auth.users.email IS NULL` (simple `!user.email` server-side check — no dismissal, no throttling, no login-count logic)
- Hint disappears automatically when email is added (next render has `auth.users.email` populated)
- Reuses existing `navAlertWrap`/`navDot`/`navAlert` CSS from Listings `1 expiring soon` pattern — zero new CSS
- UI spec: `dashboard_settings_hint_final_UI_Spec.md`
- Mockup: `dashboard_settings_hint_final.html`

## Page 8 — Listings (`/model/listings`)
**File:** `listings_final.html`

- Country display: JS map for common abbreviations (UAE/UK/US), no schema change
- Share icon: shares the listing's payment link `/{slug}/listing/{token}`
- Delete rules: Active = blocked modal; Trial/Pending/Expired = hard DELETE
- Click count: combines `listing_instagram_click` + `listing_media_click`
- Expired listings: shown indefinitely, manual delete only

## Page 9 — Wishlist (`/model/wishlist`)
**File:** `wishlist_incl_wish_delete_modal_final.html`

- Added `professional_city` + `professional_country` columns to `model_wishes`
- Updated Add Wish form to capture city + country (HTML + spec already updated)
- [Open] button uses `stripe_payment_intent_id` from `model_wish_payments` → `/wish/confirmation/{pi_xxx}`
- API endpoint: `/api/model/wishes` (auth via session)

## Page 10 — Analytics (`/model/analytics`)
**File:** `analytics_final.html`

- Top gifter ranked by total $ gifted (sum of gross_amount). **Anonymous gifters EXCLUDED from named ranking** (their gifts still count in total earnings, just not in top-gifter list). SQL pattern: `WHERE mw.gifter_is_anonymous = false GROUP BY mw.gifter_name ORDER BY SUM(mwp.gross_amount) DESC`
- Fee display = gross (already locked)
- Pull to refresh = UX only
- Period boundaries = rolling (last 7 / 30 days)
- Trend comparison = vs previous equivalent period

## Page 11 — Settings (`/model/settings`)
**File:** `settings.html` (existing) + `settings_login_methods_final.html` + `settings_add_modals.html` (Slice 1.5)

- Added `is_published` (bool default true) to `model_profiles`. Toggle OFF → public page returns 404 (reuses 404 template)
- Ambassador can self-delete (REVISES earlier "admin only" decision); 3-step modal already designed
- No profile photo (correctly omitted)
- Copy URL — clipboard
- **Currency LOCKED at signup, displayed with 🔒 icon, no change in Settings**

**Slice 1.5 additions:**
- Contact card renamed to **Login methods** card (HTML comment only; no visible section header — matches the no-header style of all other Settings cards)
- Two rows: WhatsApp + Email. Row order dynamic: signup method first, added method second (per decision #21)
- Empty-state row (method not linked): pink `Add email` / `Add WhatsApp` label with pink chevron → opens new Add modal
- Filled-state row: white value with grey chevron → opens existing Change modal (unchanged behavior)
- **Add email modal:** 2 steps (Enter email → Check your email), calls `supabase.auth.updateUser({ email })`. Subtitle: *"Add an email to recover your account."*
- **Add WhatsApp modal:** 3 steps (Enter number → Enter OTP → WhatsApp added!), calls AUTHKey send/verify then `supabase.auth.updateUser({ phone })`. Subtitle: *"Add WhatsApp for faster access."* Step 3 shows single centered "ADDED" card (not Old→New comparison like Change flow)
- Account card: "Log out" row label → **"Logout"** (single word, one-word-change)
- UI specs: `settings_login_methods_final_UI_Spec.md` + `settings_add_modals_UI_Spec.md`

## Page 12 — Add listing form (`/model/listings/new`)
**File:** `add_listing_final.html`

- NO smart-match overlay — Instagram is the LAST field; uniqueness check on submit (server)
- `model_professionals.avatar_photo_url` changed from nullable to **NOT NULL** (form requires it)
- Free trial saves: `status='free_trial'`, `is_free_trial=true`, `free_trial_ends_at=now()+30d`, prices NULL
- Post-create redirects: trial → `/model/listings`, paid → `/model/listings/[id]/send-link`
- Currency read-only from profile

## Page 13 — Add wish form (`/model/wishlist/new`)
**File:** `add_wish_final.html` (UPDATED — city + country added)

- Service column = text only (`service_name`) — no FK to categories
- Post-create redirect: `/model/wishlist?created={wish_id}` for celebration toast
- All fields required: service, professional name, city, country, price
- Currency locked from profile

## Page 14 — Send Payment Link (`/model/listings/[id]/send-link`)
**File:** `send_payment_link_after_listing.html`

- **Editable prices** are mutable on `model_listings`; payment row snapshots are immutable. Same payment link reflects current prices.
- URL format updated to `/{slug}/listing/{token}` (8-char) — match schema during integration
- WhatsApp pre-filled message: ambassador first name + pro name + link
- All entry points correct
- **Trial → Paid conversion (STACKED, not absorbed):** trial days remain valid; paid period starts when trial ends (Day 31), not at payment date

## Page 15 — Onboarding (`/model/setup`)
**File:** `onboarding_register_model_final.html`

- After auth with no profile → `/model/setup`
- Post-onboarding → `/model` (dashboard with celebration greeting)
- Slug check: debounced API call to `/api/model/profiles/check-slug`
- Instagram prefill from `users.instagram_handle` if available
- Currency LOCKED at signup
- Cover photo OPTIONAL (public page shows placeholder if missing)

## Page 16 — Auth Main Page (`/model/auth`)
**File:** `auth_page_final.html` (redesigned in Slice 1.5)

- WhatsApp OTP via **AUTHKey** called directly from our edge (Path B — see Slice 1.5 handoff Phase A; Supabase native phone provider blocked by broken dashboard form, so no Send SMS Hook)
- **WhatsApp-primary** per decision #19. Page leads with country picker + phone input + "Continue with WhatsApp" button.
- "No WhatsApp? **Continue with email →**" fallback link at bottom, routes to `/model/auth/email` (see Page 16b)
- Calls `POST /api/ambassador/auth/send-otp` (Turnstile + rate-limit + `otp_verifications` insert + AUTHKey send); verify route then mints session via `auth.admin.createUser({ phone, phone_confirm: true, email: synthetic, email_confirm: true })` + `generateLink`
- **Synthetic `wa_*@auth.internal` email is a session-mint fixture only** — hidden from UI by `isInternalEmail` filter (per decision #20 Path B amendment)
- Single pink accent line below wordmark (animates scaleX 0→1 on mount)
- No status bar chrome (OS renders it), no "Enter your number" pretext
- Emoji flags (renders correctly across all platforms incl. Windows)
- Rate limiting: 3/phone/hour, 10/IP/hour
- Legal footer: Terms → `welovedecode.com/#terms`, Privacy → `welovedecode.com/#privacy`, both open in new tab
- UI spec: `auth_page_final_UI_Spec.md`

## Page 16b — Auth Email Fallback (`/model/auth/email`)
**File:** `auth_email_page_final.html` (Slice 1.5)

- Secondary entry for users without WhatsApp (lost phone, different device, no WhatsApp account)
- Only entry point: "No WhatsApp?" link from `/model/auth`
- Single email input + "Continue with Email" button
- Calls `supabase.auth.signInWithOtp({ email })` for magic-link delivery
- Magic link routes to `/model/auth/sent` (existing Page 18) for "check your email" confirmation
- Fallback link at bottom: `← Use WhatsApp instead` returns to `/model/auth`
- Same wordmark, accent line, legal footer as `/model/auth` — brand consistency
- No password field anywhere (passwordless flow)
- `autocomplete="email"` on input for mobile keyboard suggestions
- UI spec: `auth_email_page_final_UI_Spec.md`

## Page 17 — Auth WhatsApp Verify (`/model/auth/verify`)
**File:** `auth_whatsapp_code_verify_final.html`

- Phone persistence: server session
- Auto-submit on 6th digit
- 30-second resend cooldown
- Wrong code: inline error, keep digits, force resend after 3 fails
- Code expiry: show error + clear boxes + force resend (Claude Code implements if not existing)
- Browser back: allow back to `/model/auth`

## Page 18 — Auth Magic Link Sent (`/model/auth/sent`)
**File:** `auth_magic_link_email_sent_final.html`

- Email persistence: server session
- 30-second resend cooldown
- **Magic link expiry: 15 minutes** (set in Supabase, update HTML "10 minutes" → "15 minutes")
- Standard Supabase tab/device flexibility
- Browser back: allow back to `/model/auth`
- "Open email" tracker = visual only, no mail-app button

## Page 19 — Change Email Confirmation (`/model/auth/email-changed`)
**File:** `change_email_confirmation_final.html`

- Emails in URL query (minimal risk, helpful UX)
- Standard Supabase `updateUser({email})` flow
- Standard Supabase logged-out redirect
- No audit trail for V1
- Errors handled by `/model/auth/email-error`

## Page 20 — Wish Already Gifted (`/wish/taken`)
**File:** `payment_gift_taken_already_final.html` (UPDATED — "Back to" → "Go to")

- URL query params (slug + first name — public data)
- History replace (prevents back-button loop)
- Standard 404 for non-existent wish (vs locked-but-not-paid)
- Single page for locked vs completed (keep simple)
- No try-again retry for V1

## Page 21 — Listing Payment Link Expired (`/expired`)
**File:** `payment_link_no_longer_active_final.html` (UPDATED — added "Go to WeLoveDecode" button + subtitle)

- Button text: **"Go to WeLoveDecode"** → `/` (matches Pages 20 + 404)
- No professional name shown (keep simple)
- `<meta name="robots" content="noindex">` + HTTP 410 Gone (industry standard)
- Expired/deleted → this page; Invalid token → 404
- No retry path

# PHASE 11 — EXISTING SUPABASE SCHEMA NOTES

19 existing tables in production. Key reused ones:

**`users`** (22 cols, REUSE)
- Roles: Admin / Staff / Model / Buyer
- CHECK constraint already allows email OR phone_number nullable
- Has: email, phone_number, instagram_handle (UNIQUE), role, user_name, profile_photo_url

**`user_bank_accounts`** (18 cols, USE THIS — plural version)
- Has: bank_name, beneficiary_name, iban_number, swift_code, is_primary, is_verified, status
- Note: `user_bank_account` (singular, 10 cols) is duplicate — DO NOT USE

**`webhook_events`** (11 cols, REUSE)
- Has event_id (Stripe idempotency), event_type, event_data (jsonb), status

**Existing RLS pattern to copy:**
```sql
EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE users.id = auth.uid() AND users.role = 'Model')
EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE users.id = auth.uid() AND users.role = 'Admin')
```

**Existing trigger pattern:** `set_updated_at()` function (use for all new tables)

**Known security bug to flag (NOT in our scope but worth fixing):**
`payment_links [SELECT] Public can view active payment links USING((is_active = true))` — public read of all active payment links. Major existing hole.

---

# PHASE 12 — INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLAUDE CODE HANDOFF (PHASE C)

When the schema + audit phases are done, the final Claude Code prompt must include:

1. **All 9 SQL CREATE TABLE statements** with indexes, RLS, triggers, CHECK constraints
2. **Seed data** for `model_categories` (26 rows)
3. **Reused tables list** — do not create new versions of these
4. **Stripe Payment Intents flow** (NOT Stripe Checkout — custom modal UI)
5. **Atomic claim pattern** for wish payment race protection
6. **Fee math** — server splits 80/20 ONCE at payment, stores explicitly, never recalculates
7. **No fake emails** in new ambassador auth flow (allow `users.email = NULL`)
8. **Storage bucket** — `model-media` for cover photos, listing media, professional avatars
9. **Auth bypass** — new auth pages call existing Supabase patterns; don't rebuild auth
10. **Route groups** — put new feature in `app/(ambassador)/` to isolate from `app/(legacy)/`. Each group has its own layout. Old app keeps its current bundling, zero contamination.
11. **Trial-stacking rule** — new paid period = MAX(now, MAX(paid_until, free_trial_ends_at))
12. **Magic link expiry** — set Supabase to 15 minutes (900 seconds)
13. **AUTHKey integration** for WhatsApp OTP — Claude Code reads AUTHKey docs and matches existing app implementation
14. **Stripe presentment** — capture `presentment_amount` + `presentment_currency` from `paymentIntent.latest_charge`, store on payment row, display on receipt only
15. **HTTP status codes** — 410 Gone for expired payment links, 404 for non-existent slugs/tokens, `noindex` meta on terminal pages

## Performance & bundling rules (CRITICAL)

16. **Per-page imports only** — NO monolithic bundles. Each page imports only what it needs. Let Next.js code-split naturally per route. Do NOT create a global wrapper that loads everything upfront.

17. **Lazy-load heavy libraries** — Use `next/dynamic` to load these ONLY when their page is visited:
    - **Chart.js** → only on `/model/analytics`
    - **Stripe.js + Stripe Elements** → only on checkout pages (`/{slug}/listing/{token}`, `/{slug}/wish/{token}`)
    - **Supabase Storage SDK** (upload-related code) → only on Settings, Onboarding, Add Listing
    - **Country picker dataset** (135 currencies, 250 countries) → lazy import, not in main bundle
    - Any other 50KB+ library → lazy by default

18. **Static generation (SSG) for terminal/static pages** — Pre-render at build time, serve from CDN. No server work at runtime:
    - `/terms` — static
    - `/privacy` — static
    - `/expired` — static
    - `/wish/taken` — static (URL params parsed client-side)
    - `/listing/paid` — static
    - 404 page — static
    - `/model/auth/sent` — static (email param read client-side)
    - `/model/auth/email-changed` — static (params read client-side)
    - `/model/auth/email-error` — static
    
    Use Next.js `export const dynamic = 'force-static'` or default static generation. These pages have ZERO database queries.

19. **Old app preservation** — Existing auctions / offers / pay pages keep their current styling and bundling. Do NOT refactor old code. Do NOT extract shared components from old → new. Treat the two route groups as independent applications that share a Next.js root.

**Expected bundle size:**
- Static pages: ~20KB
- Most ambassador pages: ~120KB
- Analytics page: ~250KB (with Chart.js)
- Checkout pages: ~200KB (with Stripe.js)

Without these rules: every page loads 800KB+. With them: 6x faster, especially on mobile networks.

## HTML mockup cleanup rules (CRITICAL — read carefully before stripping anything)

20. **HTML mockup cleanup** — Each `*_final.html` file in `/design/source-html/` is a self-contained design mockup. Convert to production by following these rules EXACTLY. Be conservative: when in doubt, KEEP it. Do NOT aggressively strip code.

### ✅ ALWAYS KEEP (do not remove)

- ALL HTML structure and markup
- ALL inline `<style>` blocks (visual reference)
- ALL CSS class names, IDs, and attributes
- ALL real JavaScript logic that handles user interactions: form validation, dropdown toggles, modal opens/closes, input formatting, debounced lookups, animation timing, OTP auto-submit, drag-to-reposition, Stripe Element initialization, share button handlers, copy-to-clipboard, country picker filtering, slug availability checks, etc.
- ALL regex patterns used for validation (e.g. `/^pi_[A-Za-z0-9]{20,40}$/`, slug regex, name sanitization)
- ALL XSS protection patterns (`textContent` usage, `history.replaceState()`, regex validation before fetch)
- ALL business logic comments that document behavior (look for blocks labeled `ENTRY POINTS`, `DATA VALIDATION`, `HISTORY HANDLING`, `SECURITY`, `Field usage`, server contract examples, endpoint references)
- The `<meta name="robots" content="noindex">` tags on terminal pages
- The `<meta charset>` and viewport tags
- HTTP status code requirements (404, 410 Gone) noted in comments

### ❌ REMOVE (mockup-only — safe to strip)

These are explicitly labeled in the files and ONLY exist for design preview:

- **Hardcoded sample data shown as defaults:**
  - `'Sara Johnson'`, `'sarajohnson'`, `'Salon de Luxe'`, `'salonluxe'` etc. as fallback default values
  - Sample arrays of fake listings/wishes/payments used for design preview
  - Hardcoded sample chart data
  - Sample bar chart percentages

- **Demo mode infrastructure** (search for and remove):
  - The entire `applyDemoMode()` function in any file
  - Code that reads `?demo=expired`, `?demo=refunded`, `?demo=presentment`, `?demo=anonymous`, `?demo=notfound` URL params
  - Comment blocks marked `MOCKUP-ONLY:` or `MOCKUP PATH` or `// MOCKUP fallback`
  - "Preview greeting" buttons (`btnFirst`, `btnReturn`) used to toggle dashboard greeting states for design review
  - `isMockup` checks (e.g. `window.location.protocol === 'file:'`)
  - Demo state toggle buttons in `_demoToggle` divs

- **Sample data initializations:**
  - `var tx = { reference: 'L8473921', amount: 70, ...mockData }` blocks that exist as fallback before real fetch — keep the FETCH logic, remove the hardcoded fallback object

### 🔄 REPLACE (transform from mockup to production)

- Hardcoded data displays → bind to real data from API endpoints documented in the inline comments and UI spec files
- Sample API response objects in comments are REFERENCES for the contract — the actual fetch must return data in that shape
- File paths in mockup code (e.g. `welovedecode.com/sarajohnson`) → use the real domain via env var or relative path

### Example — what cleanup looks like in practice

```javascript
// BEFORE (mockup):
var tx = {
  reference: 'L8473921',
  amount: 70,
  currency: 'AED',
  ambassador: { name: 'Sara Johnson', slug: 'sarajohnson' }
};
applyDemoMode(tx);  // checks ?demo= params
renderReceipt(tx);

// AFTER (production):
const pi = parsePaymentIntentFromURL();
if (!PI_REGEX.test(pi)) return showNotFound();
const tx = await fetch(`/api/listings/by-payment-intent/${pi}`).then(r => r.json());
renderReceipt(tx);
```

Notice what was kept: the regex validation, the fetch logic, the render function, the URL parsing.
What was removed: the hardcoded `tx` object and the `applyDemoMode()` call.

### Final reminder

The HTML files are FULL of intentional, well-tested business logic. Strip only the items explicitly marked as mockup. If a comment doesn't say "MOCKUP-ONLY" or "demo", assume it's important. **A mockup with sample data left in production is bad. A production app with critical validation logic accidentally removed is worse.**

## Auth integration — scope reminder (CRITICAL — do NOT over-engineer)

21. **Auth pages are THIN integration layers, not from-scratch rebuilds.** The existing app already has working Supabase auth + AUTHKey for WhatsApp OTP. The new auth pages (`/model/auth`, `/model/auth/verify`, `/model/auth/sent`, `/model/auth/email-changed`, `/model/auth/email-error`, `/model/setup`) are 10–20 lines of code each that wire the new UI to the existing auth infrastructure.

### Auth page implementation rules

- **DO import the existing Supabase client** from wherever the legacy app instantiates it (`lib/supabase.ts` or similar). Do NOT create a new client.
- **DO use existing AUTHKey integration** for WhatsApp OTP send + verify. Match the same endpoint patterns the legacy app uses.
- **DO call the correct Supabase function on form submit:**
  - Email path: `supabase.auth.signInWithOtp({ email })` for magic link send
  - Magic link callback: Supabase handles automatically via `/auth/callback` route
  - Email change: `supabase.auth.updateUser({ email: newEmail })`
- **DO handle responses simply:**
  - Success → redirect (`/model/setup` for new users, `/model` for existing)
  - Error → show toast or inline message
- **DO NOT touch session cookies, JWT handling, or token refresh logic.** Supabase manages these. Just call the SDK and trust it.
- **DO NOT write custom OTP storage, hashing, magic link generation, or session management.** All of this exists.
- **DO NOT add password authentication.** Email magic link + WhatsApp OTP are the only paths.
- **DO NOT create new auth-related database tables.** Supabase Auth schema is already in place.

### Per-page expected code size

| Page | Expected LOC |
|---|---|
| `/model/auth` | 30–40 lines (UI + 2 SDK calls: WhatsApp send, magic link send) |
| `/model/auth/verify` | 25–35 lines (OTP boxes + AUTHKey verify call) |
| `/model/auth/sent` | 15–20 lines (mostly static) |
| `/model/auth/email-changed` | 15–20 lines (mostly static) |
| `/model/auth/email-error` | 10 lines (static page) |
| `/model/setup` | 60–80 lines (form + slug check + profile insert) |

**Total auth-page code: ~150–200 lines.** If Claude Code writes 500+ lines of auth code, something has gone wrong — review and simplify.

### What "thin integration" looks like

```typescript
// /model/auth — email magic link path
async function continueWithEmail() {
  const email = emailInput.value.trim();
  const { error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithOtp({ email });
  if (error) return showToast(error.message);
  router.push(`/model/auth/sent?email=${encodeURIComponent(email)}`);
}
```

That's it. ~5 lines of actual auth logic. The rest of the page is UI + validation + toast handling.

## Stripe integration — isolation from legacy payment flows (CRITICAL)

22. **Stripe must be ISOLATED from existing auction/offer payment code.** Same Stripe account (one company = one Stripe account), but new code paths, new webhook endpoint, new metadata tags. Zero contamination.

### Stripe account & keys

- **Same Stripe account** as the legacy app (auctions, offers, etc.)
- **Same API keys** read from existing env vars (`STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`)
- Do NOT create new test/prod accounts or new key pairs

### NEW webhook endpoint

- Create a NEW webhook URL: `/api/webhooks/ambassador-stripe`
- Configure this URL in Stripe Dashboard (separate from existing legacy webhook URL)
- This endpoint handles ONLY the events for the DECODE ambassador feature:
  - `payment_intent.succeeded` (listing or wish payment completed)
  - `payment_intent.payment_failed` (revert wish status to 'available')
  - `charge.refunded` (mark payment as refunded, notify ambassador)
- Use the existing `webhook_events` table for idempotency (`event_id` UNIQUE)
- Old auction/offer webhooks keep their existing endpoint, untouched

### PaymentIntent metadata tagging (REQUIRED)

Every PaymentIntent created by DECODE feature MUST include metadata to identify it:

```javascript
const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
  amount: grossAmount,
  currency: ambassadorCurrency,
  metadata: {
    feature: 'ambassador',           // namespace this feature
    type: 'listing' | 'wish',    // which kind of payment
    listing_id: '...',           // OR wish_id, depending on type
    model_id: '...',             // ambassador internal ID
    payment_reference: 'L8473921' // human-readable reference
  }
});
```

The webhook handler routes events by `metadata.feature === 'ambassador'`. Old code paths ignore these. New code path ignores legacy events without this metadata. **Total isolation.**

### What Claude Code MUST NOT do

- Do NOT touch the existing webhook endpoint or its handlers
- Do NOT modify legacy PaymentIntent creation code (auctions, offers)
- Do NOT consolidate "shared Stripe utility" with legacy code — they're independent on purpose
- Do NOT create Stripe Products / Prices objects (we use dynamic PaymentIntents with custom amounts)
- Do NOT use Stripe Checkout (hosted page) — we use Stripe Payment Intents + Stripe Elements (custom modal in our UI)

### Stripe Connect status

**Not used.** All payments collect into the DECODE platform's Stripe balance. Manual payouts to ambassadors via bank transfer (Wednesdays). See Phase 1 architectural decisions.

## Loop prevention (CRITICAL — prevents browser freezes and lockouts)

23. **Two simple rules to prevent endless loops:**

### A. Bounded retries on webhook polling

Pages that wait for a webhook (listing receipt, wish receipt) MUST follow this exact pattern:
- Retry every 1 second
- **Maximum 5 retries (5 seconds total)**
- After max retries, render optimistic state (e.g. "You're live!") — NEVER keep retrying

This pattern is already specified in `listing_payment_confirmation_final_UI_Spec.md` and `wish-gift_payment_confirmation_for_gifter_final_UI_Spec.md`. Apply the same bound to ANY future polling — no exceptions.

```javascript
// CORRECT pattern
let attempts = 0;
const MAX_ATTEMPTS = 5;
async function poll() {
  const data = await fetch(...);
  if (data.status === 'pending' && attempts < MAX_ATTEMPTS) {
    attempts++;
    setTimeout(poll, 1000);
  } else {
    render(data); // either real data OR optimistic fallback
  }
}
```

### B. Auth redirect loop prevention

When redirecting between auth-related pages, follow these rules to prevent infinite loops:

- `/{slug}` where `is_published=false` → **render 404**, do NOT redirect
- `/model/auth` → if user already has session → `router.replace('/model')` (use replace, not push)
- `/model/setup` → if profile already exists → `router.replace('/model')`
- `/model/*` (any logged-in route) → if no session → `router.replace('/model/auth')`

**Always use `router.replace()` for redirects** (not `router.push()`). Replace removes the page from history, preventing back-button traps and redirect chains.

**Test for loops:** open dev tools → Network tab → if you see same URLs repeating, there's a loop. Fix immediately.

## Loading pattern — skeleton screens (LOCKED)

24. **Use skeleton screens for ALL data-fetching pages.** Do NOT use full-screen blocking spinners. Do NOT use staggered card reveals (the staggered animations in the mockup HTML are demo-only — REMOVE in production).

### Pattern

1. Page structure renders instantly (header, frame, navigation, section labels)
2. Data-loading sections show as grey placeholder rectangles (skeletons)
3. Data fetches in background
4. When data arrives: skeletons fade out, real content fades in — **single transition, all at once** (no staggered reveals)

### Skeleton style (matches DECODE design tokens)

- **Background:** `#1c1c1c` (same as card bg — looks like an empty card)
- **Shimmer:** subtle gradient sweep via CSS animation (no JS)
  ```css
  @keyframes shimmer { 0% { background-position: -200% 0; } 100% { background-position: 200% 0; } }
  .skeleton {
    background: linear-gradient(90deg, #1c1c1c 0%, #262626 50%, #1c1c1c 100%);
    background-size: 200% 100%;
    animation: shimmer 1.5s infinite;
    border-radius: 12px;
  }
  ```
- **Dimensions:** match the real content exactly (no layout shift when data loads)
- **Border radius:** matches the real card (12px)
- **Transition:** 200ms fade between skeleton and content

### Where skeletons apply (data-fetching pages)

Dashboard, Listings, Wishlist, Analytics, Public page `/{slug}`, Listing receipt, Wish receipt, Send Payment Link, Payouts list, Payout statement.

### Where skeletons do NOT apply (instant render)

Auth pages, Onboarding form, Add Listing/Wish forms (empty inputs), static pages (Terms, Privacy, 404, Expired), edge case pages (wish taken, listing paid), Settings (uses pre-loaded user data).

### What to REMOVE from mockup HTMLs

The mockup HTML files contain demo animations like:
- Cards appearing one-by-one with staggered `setTimeout` delays
- Counter animations on stat numbers
- Bar fill animations triggered after page load

In production: render data instantly when fetched. No staggered reveals. The animations make the mockup feel "alive" for design review but are jarring in production. Skeletons handle the loading state — once data is ready, just show it.

Plus reference docs:
- This master document
- All `*_final.html` files (in `/design/source-html/`)
- All `*_UI_Spec.md` files (in `/design/ui-specs/`)
- The current architecture docx

## Pre-launch checklist

Values intentionally set to dev/testing defaults during slice work that
MUST be reset before launch. This is the canonical list — Claude Code
updates it as entries are added or resolved.

| # | Item | Current state | Required before launch | Added in slice |
|---|------|---------------|------------------------|----------------|
| 1 | `authPhoneLimiter` rate limit | 20/hr (loose for testing) | Reset to 3/hr | Slice 1 |
| 2 | Cloudflare Turnstile protection | (a) `/model/auth` (OTP + magic link): non-blocking mode — `verifyTurnstile` is called but fail-open on empty token (token-loading bug, deferred). Resend path also relies on rate limits (per-email + per-IP) as the bot-protection floor — **accepted risk** (Slice 1 Phase 1 review, 2026-04-19). (b) `/api/ambassador/model/setup`: NOT IMPLEMENTED — any logged-in user can automate profile creation. | (a) Flip auth routes to blocking verification (resend bypass acceptable). (b) Add client widget + server-side `verifyTurnstile` to the setup route. | Slice 1 |
| 3 | Dashboard week-boundary timezone | UTC (no `users.timezone` column) | Acceptable for v1. Revisit if ambassadors in UTC±8 or beyond report wrong "this week" counts | Slice 1 |
| 4 | iOS 26 Safari browser chrome color | Shows default blue instead of #000001 (themeColor in ambassador layout). Platform-level WebKit bug in iOS 26.0/26.1 affecting all websites using theme-color meta. Code is correct. | Monitor iOS 26.2 release (expected to ship WebKit fix). If not fixed there, accept as platform limitation. | Slice 1 |
| 5 | Orphan `model_professionals` cleanup | Cascade-delete when an ambassador deletes their account intentionally skips `model_professionals` because rows are shared across ambassadors (one row can be referenced by multiple ambassadors' listings/wishes). Orphaned rows with zero remaining references stay in the table indefinitely. | Build a periodic cleanup job that deletes `model_professionals` rows with no remaining references in `model_listings` or `model_wishes` — OR accept as inert garbage and skip. | Slice 1 |
| 6 | ~~Send SMS Hook secret~~ | **OBSOLETE (Slice 1.5 Path B):** Send SMS Hook is no longer used; OTP delivery is AUTHKey-direct from our edge. The `SUPABASE_SEND_SMS_HOOK_SECRET` env var should be removed from Vercel and the Send SMS Hook disabled in the Supabase dashboard. | Confirm env var removed and dashboard hook disabled. | Slice 1.5 |
| 7 | AUTHKey WhatsApp UTILITY template for OTP | Dev environment uses UTILITY template (shared with Slice 0 OTP send) | Confirm Meta-approved template still in good standing at launch; fallback plan documented | Slice 1.5 |
| 8 | FK cascade `auth.users` ↔ `public.users` | Unverified. `public.users` has no FK to `auth.users`, so `DELETE FROM auth.users` does NOT cascade to `public.users` and the row is left orphaned (15+ tables FK to `public.users`, so a stale row keeps domain data alive too). Mirror direction (delete public → auth) also undefined. Discovered during Slice 1.5 Phase A smoke testing while cleaning up failed signup test rows. | Verify required cascade direction(s) and either (a) add explicit FK `public.users.id REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE`, or (b) implement an app-level "Delete profile" route that deletes both rows transactionally. Delete-profile UX relies on this working before launch. | Slice 1.5 |
| 9 | Phone-dedupe scalability in verify-otp | `app/api/ambassador/auth/verify-otp/route.ts` finds the existing `auth.users` row via `admin.listUsers({ page: 1, perPage: 1000 })` and filters client-side by `phone`. Works today (small user base) but silently misses users 1001+ — reintroducing the phantom-row bug that commit `f3e886e` fixed. | Replace `listUsers({ perPage: 1000 })` with a `public.find_auth_user_by_phone(phone text) RETURNS TABLE(id uuid, email text)` SECURITY DEFINER RPC (indexed lookup, O(1)) when user count exceeds 500. | Slice 1.5 |

**Format for new entries:** Item name, current state with reason, what
"resolved" looks like, and which slice added the item. Append only;
don't renumber existing rows when adding new ones.

**When an item is resolved:** Strike through the row (or move to a
"Resolved" subsection below) with the commit hash and date.

## Slice 1 polish footnote

Slice 1 polish landed in commits `0bbd3e6`, `4fdb374`, `3c12096`, `4207d3b` — see commit messages for cover-photo upload fixes (unique-path Storage keys + delete-old-cover) and Phase 2 hardening details (dropped dead `Model insert own profile` RLS policy, `crypto.randomInt` for OTP, magic-link route cleanup, shared `maskEmail` + `isValidInstagramHandle` helpers, narrowed file-input `accept` attribute, ProgressTracker `step=4` extraction).

# RESUME INSTRUCTIONS (if chat dies)

If you're a fresh chat reading this, the user wants to continue with:

**"Phase B is complete. All 21 pages are audited and locked. Schema is final (9 tables, 135 columns). Now move to Phase C — write the comprehensive Claude Code handoff prompt for actual implementation. Use this DECODE_PROJECT_STATE.md + all final HTML files + UI specs as authoritative source."**

The handoff prompt should be a complete, standalone brief that Claude Code can use to implement the entire feature without needing to ask questions back.
