This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

### Cron Jobs

This app includes a weekly payout cron job configured in `vercel.json`. The cron job runs every Monday at midnight GST (Sunday 8 PM UTC).

To enable the cron job:
1. Set the `CRON_SECRET` environment variable in your Vercel project settings
2. The cron job will automatically be registered when you deploy to Vercel
3. The job will process payouts for all active beauty professionals every Monday

The cron endpoint is `/api/cron/weekly-payouts` and requires the `CRON_SECRET` for authentication.
