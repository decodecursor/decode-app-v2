## 📋 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Database Setup
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Run `SUPABASE_COMPLETE_SETUP.sql` first (if fresh database)
3. Then run `DATABASE_MIGRATION_FINAL.sql` to align with code

### Step 2: Vercel Environment Variables
Set these in Vercel Dashboard (found in `DEPLOYMENT.md`):
- All Supabase keys
- All Crossmint keys  
- Email configuration
- Webhook secrets

### Step 3: Deploy
```bash
vercel --prod
```

### Step 4: Test
- Test payment at `/payment`
- Test real payment links at `/pay/[linkId]`
- Check wallet creation in database
- Verify webhook processing
